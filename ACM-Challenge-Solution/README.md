# ACM Coding Challenge Solution

Name: Keerthi Srilakshmidaran

This code outputs the image as a PNG and also saves the image to the specified
location on your computer. The output is a simple circular genome graph with
feature labels.

Note: For the code to be reproduced, the location of the file has to be changed 
depending on where it is saved.

## Packages used
* Biopython's Genome Diagram
* Reportlab's Colors

## Sources and Documentation
* [BioPython SeqIO](https://biopython.org/wiki/SeqIO)
* [BioPython GenomeDiagram](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/GenomeDiagram/userguide.pdf)

Thanks for this opportunity!
